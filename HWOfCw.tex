\paragraph{Yes, I do see myself contributing to FOSS projects in the future. Open-source software plays a vital role in fostering innovation and collaboration, and I am excited about the idea of contributing to such projects. I would be particularly interested in contributing to development tools, such as text editors and automation scripts, as well as programming languages and scientific computing libraries. Additionally, I would like to contribute to improving documentation and tutorials for users, ensuring that open-source projects are more accessible to a wider audience. Overall, I believe that contributing to FOSS is a great way to learn, collaborate, and give back to the community.}
